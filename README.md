# MovieAPI-Using-Asp.Net-Core
 I have written 3 API 
  https://localhost:44395/api/Movies
  https://localhost:44395/api/Movies/metadata/    here we need a parameter movieID
  https://localhost:44395/api/Movies/stats
  database is a CSV file.
  I used Visual studio 2019 for develop this app.
  Here I used backend as CSV files. Here I haven't attached the CSV files.
  We have a constants class in the solution. We can change the CSV file path from there.
